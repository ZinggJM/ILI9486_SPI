# ILI9486_SPI for Arduino

This library supports ILI9486 SPI TFT to use with Adafruit_GFX

The code is extracted from GxTFT and adapted for single controller use and Adafruit_GFX.

Can be used with the "special" SPI circuit found on RPi and Waveshare TFTs.
Can also be used with the native SPI connection of the controller, as used on other TFTs.
